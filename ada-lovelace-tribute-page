      <h2>Her Life and Contributions</h2>
      <p>Ada Lovelace was the daughter of the famous poet Lord Byron. She showed a keen interest in mathematics and science, working closely with Charles Babbage on his Analytical Engine, a mecha/nical general-purpose computer.</p>
      <ul>
                <li><strong>1833:</strong> She met Charles Babbage, marking the beginning of her interest in the Analytical Engine.</li>
                <li><strong>1843:</strong> She translated the notes of Italian mathematician Luigi Menabrea about the Engine, adding her own extensive annotations.</li>
                <li><strong>Her Notes:</strong> Within her annotations was an algorithm intended to be processed by the machine to compute Bernoulli numbers, which is recognized as the first computer program.</li>
                <li><strong>Her Vision:</strong> Lovelace foresaw the machine's potential to go beyond mere calculations (such as composing music), anticipating the scope of computer science a century in advance.</li>
            </ul>
